# Logiaric-Regression


implementing a classifier using logistic regression from scratch and compare the results with another logistic classifier implemented using scikit-learn. 

## Project overview

This notebook provided by this repository is divided into two main parts:
 - Implementing a simple binary classifier that uses a linear decision boundary.
 - Implementing a bindary classifier that uses a non-linear decision boundary.
